**Behind-the-scenes disagreements and communication breakdowns between the TTC and Metrolinx over the safety of the** [**Eglinton Crosstown LRT**](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/crosstown/) **spilled into the public this week, putting the line’s expected Feb. 8 opening date in jeopardy.**

**While sources and the TTC chair Jamaal Myers have pointed to randomly activating emergency brakes as a critical safety issue that gave the TTC pause regarding an opening date next weekend, an email viewed by the Star between the TTC and Metrolinx CEOs shows that Metrolinx believed the issue would not hinder a** [**Feb. 8 opening**](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/eglinton-crosstown-lrt-to-open-feb-8-not-so-fast-says-ttc-ceo/article_c4406328-fcb4-444f-975d-08700a612d6a.html)**.**

**Now Metrolinx, which owns the Crosstown, and the TTC, which runs the line, publicly appear to be out of sync — Metrolinx maintains that the line is safe, while the TTC has declined to comment on concerns about it, leaving a city that has waited 15 years for the Crosstown to open waiting again for clarity.**

## **TTC, Metrolinx disagree about safety**

**In the email, sent by Metrolinx CEO Michael Lindsay to TTC CEO Mandeep Lali on Monday, Lindsay explained that, while random braking errors spiked on Jan. 7, they declined later in the month as Metrolinx worked with Crosslinx, the private contractor that built the line, to fix the issue. There were four instances in the rest of January, Lindsay said in the email, where the brakes were randomly set off, adding that the braking issue had been previously discussed at meetings with the TTC and Crosslinx.**

**The email ended with Lindsay extending an offer to call. In Metrolinx’s view, the issues were not a hindrance to the opening of the line.**

**The next day, at the Toronto Region Board of Trade,** [**Lali declined to confirm a Feb. 8 opening date**](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/eglinton-crosstown-lrt-to-open-feb-8-not-so-fast-says-ttc-ceo/article_c4406328-fcb4-444f-975d-08700a612d6a.html)**, citing outstanding concerns with the line that had yet to be addressed by Metrolinx.**
